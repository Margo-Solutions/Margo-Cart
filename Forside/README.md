Installing dependencies into an Expo managed project​

Installing the native stack navigator library​
The libraries we've installed so far are the building blocks and shared foundations for navigators, 
and each navigator in React Navigation lives in its own library. 
To use the native stack navigator, we need to install @react-navigation/native-stack :

npm install @react-navigation/native-stack
